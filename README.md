# arduino-nofrost-controller
 Simple No-Frost controller for refrigerator using an Arduino

 It was made and tested using an Arduino UNO and some DIY modules:
 - 5v Relay module
 - DS18B20 temperature sensor
 - Push button module (I use the pull-up resistor from arduino, not from the module)
 - 5mm orange LED

 The diagrams folder includes an old (and bad) PCB design just for reference and to understand why some particular GPIOs are available.
 You can use any GPIO you want in your code.
